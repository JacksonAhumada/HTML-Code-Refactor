# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to update the HTML code to be a more semantic HTML code. I wanted to clean up the code enough so that there was a precise flow of logical structure for anyone else who would possibly be working in this code. I felt it necessary to update the style sheet as well to help retain the styling that was being implemented in the previous code.
